PyCity Schools Analysis & Observations

• Overall, all schools performed better in reading (100%) rather than Math (92%) since the average reading score is higher than the average math score at every school in the city. • The charter schools performed better at math and reading than the district schools • Performance did not correlate to amount spent per student, but to the size of the school and type. The smaller schools, which were all charter schools, performed better. • District schools performed far low across the board in math and reading scores than charter schools and the lowest scores were also observed among schools that spend the most per student, and the largest schools) • Higher Per Student Budget not necessary lead to a higher grade, for example Cabrera High School, who has the highest passing rate spent less than 600 dollar budget per student, and the bottom 5 school all have budget per student higher than 600 dollar. In addition, schools spent lower than 615 dollar per student has significant (15%) higher scores than over 615 dollar. The highest spending category 645-675 got the lowest score. • School type matters. All Top 5 school are Charter school, and 5 Bottom schools are District Schools. Overall variance between these two on passing rate are 23%, Charter schools are higher. Charter school performed especially well in math score. • Larger size schools doesn’t show good performance in score, compared to median size and small size school. However once the school size goes below 2000 students, the change are not significant.
